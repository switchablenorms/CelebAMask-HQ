**CelebAMask-HQ** is a large-scale face image dataset that has **30,000** high-resolution face images selected from the CelebA dataset by following CelebA-HQ. Each image has segmentation mask of facial attributes corresponding to CelebA.

The masks of CelebAMask-HQ were manually-annotated with the size of **512 x 512** and **19 classes** including all facial components and accessories such as skin, nose, eyes, eyebrows, ears, mouth, lip, hair, hat, eyeglass, earring, necklace, neck, and cloth. 

CelebAMask-HQ can be used to **train and evaluate algorithms of face parsing, face recognition, and GANs for face generation and editing**.

* If you need the identity labels and the attribute labels of the images, please send request to the [CelebA team](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

## Face Manipulation Model with CelebAMask-HQ
CelebAMask-HQ can be used on several research fields including: facial image manipulation, face parsing, face recognition, and face hallucination. We showcase an application on interactive facial image manipulation as bellow:
